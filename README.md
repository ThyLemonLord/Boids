## An Investigation into Drone Swarms & Swarm Intelligence

# Abstract
The management of drone swarms currently faces multiple logistical issues, particularly concerning
collisions between members and with the environment. Groups of animals, such as flocks of birds
and schools of fish, exhibit behaviours to stay as a cohesive flock, whilst avoiding injury from
collisions. Such behaviours could be applied in the case of simulating drone swarms.
In this project, I suggest expansions to Crag Reynolds’ Swarm Intelligence (SI) Model (Reynolds,
1987), [which originally codified behaviours in birds into so-called “oracles”, or rules] with the
overarching aim to simulate a swarm of drones free of collisions. I experimented with variations for
each SI oracle, along with additional proposed oracles, combined with environmental obstacle
avoidance, to investigate whether the SI oracles and suggested additions could indeed simulate a
successful drone swarm. I first defined and experimented with these technologies in 2 dimensions,
until an effective and realistic model was achieved, and then extended this model into complex 3-
dimensional environments.
The simulations demonstrated a successful application of these oracles, confirming that Reynolds’
model for flocks of birds can indeed be modified and expanded to realistically simulate and guide
swarms of drones. Furthermore, with such a large domain of parameter tuning, one can adjust the
simulation to simulate a range of swarm types: from natural swarms (e.g., flocks of birds), to
synthetic swarms (e.g.: swarms of drones). This gives this simulation a wide range of use cases and
adaptability to more complex environments.
